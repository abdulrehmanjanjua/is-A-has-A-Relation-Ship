	//It works. The house object now has a feature to bark at the thief and scare them away. But, at the same time it inherited other features of Dog, like wagging its tail, pee on 3 legs, sniffing, etc.
	// Here, the programmer failed to understand the difference between IS-A and HAS-A relationships. When House inherits a Dog, it’s an IS-A relationship. Or in other words, House IS A Dog. That doesn’t make any sense, does it? How can a house become a dog? How can a house wag its tail or sniff?
